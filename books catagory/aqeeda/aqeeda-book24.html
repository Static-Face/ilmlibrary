                <p class="book-description"><strong>Description:</strong> Some people think that the issue of jinn, demons, and devils is one that should remain on the periphery of knowledge. They believe in going over this topic in the quickest of fashions and not giving it too much thought. They think that the benefits of such a study are very limited, and that being ignorant of this topic is not harmful at all. They say ‘seeing is believing’, but how often do we remind ourselves that what we can’t see still exists? Among Muslims, the important tenet of belief in jinn and devils is often forgotten. However, this is not an irrelevant matter. Humans today spend billions of dollars, with which they could develop countries and end poverty in the farthest reaches of the world, on research to discover whether there is any possibility of life on nearby planets. Scientists spend a great deal of their time and resources on this question. What about living beings that are known to exist right here with us on our earth? They live in our houses and they eat and drink with us. In fact, they affect our thoughts and our hearts and even drive us to destroy our own selves and to spill each other’s blood. No price can be put on the importance of the texts of the Qur’an and authentic hadiths that have reached us, giving us knowledge of this matter. Dr. ‘Umar al-Ashqar shows us how those texts uncover for us the secrets of these fellow-creatures: the world of the jinn. Adequate knowledge about their existence can help in our constant struggle to resist their influence. It will also help us in reaching the ultimate goal of creating the everlasting bond and closeness to Allah, the Beneficent, that we all seek.</p>
