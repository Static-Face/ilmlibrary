                <p class="book-description"><strong>Description:</strong> Although the vast majority of mankind believe in a Creator or Supreme Being, their concepts vary. Islam, in the Qur'an and Sunnah, affirms the existence and Oneness of the Creator and describes Him as having the most perfect attributes, thus enabling man to have the proper concept of Him and to establish a strong bond with Him based on the understanding of His sublime attributes. But the influence of philosophy and other ideas that are alien to Islam led to the emergence of distorted concepts about ALLAH. Dr. 'Umar S. al-Ashqar discusses the wrong ideas that have crept into Muslims' minds concerning ALLAH and His attributes, and highlights the fact that the only correct way to understand the verses of the Qur'an and the ahaadeeth, which speak of ALLAH and His attributes, is the way in which they were understood by the first generations of this ummah (the salaf). Dr. Al-Ashqar also examines modern concepts, such as the theory of evolution, and proves that they are wrong and false. Following the Qur'anic injunction to ponder the signs of Allah in the universe, he also pays attention to the study of natural phenomena which clearly point to the existence and Oneness of the Almighty Creator. Thus, Dr. Al-Ashqar affirms the principle which lies as the heart of Islamic faith and practice, namely Tawheed, the Absolute Oneness of the Divine.</p>
